00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.600
Good.

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:55.004
That was lovely, Moll.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:56.440
I need more from you.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.480
Can we take it from the beginning?

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:02.606
And...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.300
I was obsessed by killer

00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:09.740
whales when I was a kid.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.500
They always seem to be smiling.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.816
You know, they travel 100 miles a day

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:22.464
in the ocean, but in captivity, their

00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:24.540
sound waves bounce off the walls

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.260
and they become deaf and dumb.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.310
Some even go insane.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.098
I read about one whale that broke

00:03:34.098 --> 00:03:36.030
all its teeth trying to break free.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.070
Just got too much for him.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.070
He didn't want to smile anymore.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.602
I'll have a pint of Heineken

00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:50.954
and a glass of red wine, please.

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:52.740
And a bag of crisps.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.800
- Hi Cliff
- Hi

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.780
How are you?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.164
Good.

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:56.676
You?

00:03:56.676 --> 00:03:57.412
Yeah, no, I'm good.

00:03:57.412 --> 00:03:57.844
I'm good.

00:03:57.844 --> 00:03:58.164
Good.

00:03:58.164 --> 00:03:58.760
Good.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.600
Just, uh,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.436
hang on a sec.

00:04:04.436 --> 00:04:06.884
Oh, Cliff, you didn't have to.

00:04:06.884 --> 00:04:07.692
Honestly.

00:04:07.692 --> 00:04:08.084
Please.

00:04:08.084 --> 00:04:08.940
Happy birthday.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.800
Thank you.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.772
Oh.

00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:16.740
They give you one of these

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.755
when you enter the force.

00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:18.749
Wow.

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:19.728
Thank you.

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:23.669
- It just goes, uh...

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.489
- Anywhere.

00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:28.333
I think I'm..

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:28.805
Sorry. May I?

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:30.729
Okay.

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.077
You're not really supposed

00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:33.997
to give these away,

00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:36.049
but you can keep a secret.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:38.749
Hi.

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:39.605
Oh.

00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:41.229
Better say hi.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.669
No, of course.

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.333
Thanks for coming.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.060
Not at all.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.764
I'll see you later.

00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:46.028
Yeah.

00:04:46.028 --> 00:04:47.628
Help yourself to more drinks.

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:48.916
And there's plenty of food as well

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:50.060
if you want anything to eat.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.680
Sure.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.060
Oh.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.860
Who gave you that?

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.600
Oh, Clifford.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.680
How sweet.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.000
I'd like to make a toast

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.868
to someone very special.

00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:08.724
Someone we can all rely on.

00:05:08.724 --> 00:05:10.140
Happy birthday, Sis.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.384
To Moll!

00:05:11.384 --> 00:05:12.380
To Moll!

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.816
And while she's got you lot to be

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:17.040
quiet for the moment, we would like

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.560
to take this opportunity to announce.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.740
Spence and me are expecting twins.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.552
Get the champagne.

00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:29.128
Sweetheart.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.424
There's a case in the garage.

00:05:30.424 --> 00:05:31.320
The champagne.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.592
Don't pull that face.

00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:33.480
She's having twins.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.100
Moll.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.490
I frightened you.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.774
What's going here?

00:09:14.774 --> 00:09:15.510
I've got to go home.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.534
Oh, come on.

00:09:16.534 --> 00:09:17.126
I spent the whole night

00:09:17.126 --> 00:09:17.742
buying you drinks.

00:09:17.742 --> 00:09:18.870
I know.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.718
I've got to get

00:09:19.718 --> 00:09:21.278
home and look after my dad.

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:21.926
He'll be all right.

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:22.974
Just a little kiss.

00:09:22.974 --> 00:09:24.438
Don't do that, please.

00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:29.374
- Why?
- Don't.

00:09:29.374 --> 00:09:30.490
I need to get home.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.214
Home.

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:34.798
Don't.

00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:36.054
Just a little kiss.

00:09:36.054 --> 00:09:36.552
I don't.

00:09:36.552 --> 00:09:37.760
I need this.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.500
Come on.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.380
Please don't take that.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.020
What are you doing, you freak?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.020
What?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.980
Do you know how to use that?

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.560
You're wounded.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.840
I can fix that.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.590
You got blood on your hands.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.360
Isn't that illegal?

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:22.300
Can you keep a secret then?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.320
I'm okay.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.770
Just missing a section on humans.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09:000
Shit!

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.026
You don't have to tell

00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:14.234
them what happened.

00:13:14.234 --> 00:13:15.170
You sure?

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.946
Yeah.

00:13:15.946 --> 00:13:17.310
I don't want any trouble.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.866
Morning, Officer.

00:13:25.866 --> 00:13:26.978
Seat belt.

00:13:26.978 --> 00:13:27.556
Yeah, sorry.

00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:31.000
We just got on the road.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.156
Up early?.

00:13:32.156 --> 00:13:32.844
You mean late.

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:37.452
We've been at the Wipeout.

00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:38.540
The, um, the DJ was great,

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.040
We couldn't stop dancing.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.480
You can breathalyze me.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.640
Incidentally, I'm an amazing dancer.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.360
Really?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.740
What do you do?

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.660
Work with my hands.
I'm a craftsman.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.360
You?

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.600
I'm a historical guide.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.650
Not the Granny Wagons?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.690
It's only temporary.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.130
Nice place.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.890
It's my parents'.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.780
I'm just helping look after my dad.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.940
Someone's birthday.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.820
Mine, actually.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.680
Happy birthday.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.740
Thank you.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:09.430
Thanks for the lift.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.410
You're safe.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.846
I was worried sick.

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:45.810
What happened?

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.342
I, um..

00:15:48.342 --> 00:15:49.370
Come here.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.410
I won't bite.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.930
I felt funny, so I went for a walk.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.530
And then I fell asleep on the beach.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.210
I thought we were best friends.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.660
- We are.
- Then don't lie to me.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.700
I just wanted to go dancing.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.760
I put all that effort into making it

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.992
special and you wanted to go dancing.

00:16:13.992 --> 00:16:14.320
So...

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.784
Sorry, mom.

00:16:16.784 --> 00:16:18.860
It was irresponsible and thoughtless.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.900
You've come so far, Moll.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.608
I worry when things like this happen.

00:16:26.608 --> 00:16:29.000
It won't happen again, I promise.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.840
It was your birthday.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.040
We'll let this one go.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.480
Eat your cake.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.816
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:03.008
Welcome to Tantivy Blue Coach Tours.

00:17:03.008 --> 00:17:05.336
My name is Mol and I will be

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:07.096
your hostess for the day.

00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:08.048
Just to give you a rough

00:17:08.048 --> 00:17:09.223
outline of what you can expect

00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:10.848
from today's travels.

00:17:10.848 --> 00:17:14.160
Firstly, um....

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500
what are you doing here?

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.320
Just wanted to check how you're doing.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.920
Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:04.996
Here,

00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:06.000
Birthday present.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.040
Thank you.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.758
My.

00:18:20.758 --> 00:18:21.094
My.

00:18:21.094 --> 00:18:21.930
My mom.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.998
Hillary.

00:18:25.998 --> 00:18:27.310
Pascal Ranouf.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.790
How do you do?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.734
Your dad needs you, sweetheart.

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:31.810
Have a pleasant evening.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.960
Who was that?

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.792
No one.

00:18:41.792 --> 00:18:42.464
Just.

00:18:42.464 --> 00:18:44.336
He gave me a lift the other night.

00:18:44.336 --> 00:18:45.940
Could smell him a mile off.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.880
My name's Moll.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.990
What are you doing Saturday?

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.874
There's a few odd jobs

00:19:11.874 --> 00:19:12.858
around the house.

00:19:12.858 --> 00:19:14.578
A bench needs fixing

00:19:14.578 --> 00:19:16.230
and some patio slabs.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:17.866
You said you were good

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:18.710
with your hands.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.310
Okay.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.652
What homework have you

00:19:43.652 --> 00:19:44.988
got tonight, Jade?

00:19:44.988 --> 00:19:46.636
Usual. Bit of math.

00:19:46.636 --> 00:19:47.520
Bit of science.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.292
How was the game?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.292
Cock-up.

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:53.760
We lost 50 quid.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.790
Mom, can Jace stay here tonight?

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.454
I've got a friend coming over.

00:20:00.454 --> 00:20:01.574
I've got a fate meeting.

00:20:01.574 --> 00:20:02.590
Sweetheart.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.638
Moll can look after her.

00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:05.302
Everyone is hoping for the best.

00:20:05.302 --> 00:20:06.894
But there is of course speculation

00:20:06.894 --> 00:20:08.166
that Melissa's disappearance is

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.158
connected to the unsolved abduction

00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:11.750
and murder of three other

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.770
girls over the past four years.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.846
It's been 22 hours since I

00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:19.570
saw Melissa tucked up in bed.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.970
And if anyone can help us to find her,

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.942
we miss her very, very much.

00:20:29.942 --> 00:20:31.190
Harrison, turn it off.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.930
We miss....

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.090
How was your game?

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.650
It was great.
