An empty street

An empty house

A hole inside my heart

I'm all alone

The rooms are getting smaller

 

I wonder how

I wonder why

I wonder where they are

The days we had

The songs we sang together

 

And oh my love

I'm holding on forever

Reaching for a love that seems so far

 

So I say a little prayer

And hope my dreams will take me there

Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love

 

Over seas and coast to coast

To find a place I love the most

Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love

 

I try to read

I go to work

I'm laughing with my friends

But i can't stop to keep myself from thinking

 

I wonder how

I wonder why

I wonder where they are

The days we had

The songs we sang together

 

And oh my love

I'm holding on forever

Reaching for a love that seems so far

 

So I say a little prayer

And hope my dreams will take me there

Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love

 

Over seas and coast to coast

To find a place I love the most

Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love

 

To hold you in my arms

To promise you my love

To tell you from the heart

You're all i'm thinking of

 

I'm reaching for a love that seems so far

 

So I say a little prayer

And hope my dreams will take me there

Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love

 

Over seas and coast to coast

To find a place I love the most

Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love

 

Say a little prayer

Dreams will take me there

Where the skies are blue to see you once again

 

Over seas and coast to coast

To find a place I love the most

Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love
