My love, please don't let love wither

Don't wake up my dream

Can you continue to pester me

You were like a beam of light

Melt my sorrow

Happiness that I flaunted

Later it became a slap in my face

My past memories became addictive pain

All the happiness was taken away by you

Countless nights without you

The more I want to forget, the more I love

The more I want to think

My love, please don't let love wither

Don't wake up my dream

Can you continue to pester me

Love loneliness engulfs me

My heart is about to be torn apart

Longing for your warm embrace

I know that there is no reason to say about feelings

I am still piecing together the broken dreams

Can you love me again

Just hold me tight and pester me

Please don't let love wither

My love, please don't let love wither

Don't wake up my dream

Can you continue to pester me

Love loneliness engulfs me

My heart is about to be torn apart

Longing for your warm embrace
