00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:43,938
Today I can finally met the Bac Lieu playboy.

00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:44,699
I've been looking forward to this day

00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:45,898
for so long.

00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:47,278
Being invited here today

00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:48,959
means you must be someone very impressive.

00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,798
Oh,

00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:01,038
Sorry for disappointing

00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,398
you all, but this isn't

00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:04,938
the real Bac Lieu playboy.

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,878
My third brother, for special reasons,

00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:09,318
couldn't be here

00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,158
to host the press today.

00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:15,278
To reciprocate the kindness that you

00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:17,058
have shown to the Bac Lieu playboy,

00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:18,398
my third brother has a small gift

00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:20,758
to express his admiration and gratitude.

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,238
You've probably heard many

00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,998
fabricated stories about the Bac Lieu playboy,

00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,898
a character who has been given

00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:31,138
epithets like the number one player, a romantic

00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:34,258
wanderer, the world's number one jade

00:01:34,258 --> 00:01:34,678
master.

00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:37,978
A character that every time you mention him, he's always

00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,478
doing things that are out of the ordinary.

00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:39,699
That's right.

00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,258
Exactly.

00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,918
If you're ready,

00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:45,418
here begins the story

00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:47,299
of the Bac Lieu playboy.

00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:55,098
The day my third brother was born

00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:56,518
was also the proudest day

00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:57,918
of my father's life.

00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,538
So don't ask why he's the son

00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:01,858
who's most pampered, and also the

00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,378
only son who dares to cling to the

00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:04,778
Five-Order Medal of my old man.

00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,818
My father?

00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:09,518
Always treasured every grain like gold,

00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:10,998
always taught us not

00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,498
to waste even a single coin.

00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,158
Yet there's a son who does whatever he likes,

00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,338
and the worst thing is that he always does

00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,518
the opposite of what he says.

00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:20,118
Where's the cane?

00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,098
You're about to witness the childhood

00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:24,718
nightmare of my brothers and me.

00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:30,758
Even after being beaten with a rattan cane, that

00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:32,558
horrifying family rule couldn't stop

00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,538
my third brother's fun.

00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,938
"Quốc" means country.

00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:40,258
"Gia" means home.

00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:41,918
If you want to govern the country,

00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:46,818
you must manage your home.

00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:04,998
(Music) One fine day, my third brother

00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,298
took a ship all the way to Paris.

00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,458
I thought leaving my father's reach would be

00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,418
a storm, but I was completely wrong.

00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,198
No matter where he is, he spends the family's

00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,798
money, so he lives

00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,858
very happily, very stylishly, even

00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,338
becoming famous.

00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:50,538
Rushing to leave, rushing to come backy.

00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:52,158
He says one thing, but acts

00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:53,458
in a way no one can predict.

00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:55,978
Who can guess what he's thinking?

00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,178
Truly, only God knows.

00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:01,278
C'est génial!

00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:02,998
Third Brother!

00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:04,638
Third Brother is back.

00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:17,518
Slow down!

00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,878
Are you still on my side or not?

00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,158
When have I ever not been on your side?

00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,218
When don't I have a gift for Sau?

00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,018
One whole carload!

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,898
Dancing, wine tasting, martial arts, driving.

00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:38,078
Oh my God!

00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:40,578
You, Ba!

00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:44,798
You took a pile of my money to

00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,778
the West and only learned these

00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:47,918
nonsense?

00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:50,578
C'est génial!

00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:51,398
Baba, you call these things

00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:52,358
nonsense?

00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:54,998
This isn't ordinary, these

00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:56,738
are all the special essences

00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,718
of the land of Paris.

00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:00,558
The magnificent capital of a

00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:02,138
modern and top-notch country.

00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:04,418
Hmph, and you call that impressive?

00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:07,898
I don't need to go to the West or Europe,

00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:08,898
yet look at what I have.

00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:10,638
Look at this, huh?

00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:13,198
See if mine is better than yours?

00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:18,158
Now that it's come to this, I have no choice

00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:18,818
but to show off the most

00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,598
(Speaking French) prestigious thing that

00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:23,078
I'm sure only I have in this whole An

00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,918
Nam region.

00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:26,938
Et voilà!

00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:30,078
What do you think, Dad, if Mr.Councilman

00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,698
Tịnh goes to inspect his fields by plane

00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,678
but driven by his own son.

00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:41,198
Listen to me.

00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,078
Okay, if you want to fly now,

00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:43,258
then go ahead and fly.

00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:44,818
But, Mom thinks that a man

00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:46,398
should settle down and start a family.

00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:48,298
If you like someone, just tell me.

00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,978
I’ll arrange the marriage right away.

00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:51,918
Merci maman!

00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,478
But now the world

00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,158
is vast, and outside there are

00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:56,678
countless beautiful people.

00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:57,558
Why tie myself down

00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,358
to only one person?

00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:00,278
If you truly love me, mama,

00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,238
then convince papa to open his wallet

00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,558
and buy me a plane,

00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:04,438
that seems better.

00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:04,918
Huh?

00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:05,158
Huh?

00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:06,858
What did you just say?

00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:12,316
You want to buy a plane? Okay, fine,

00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,296
you want to buy a plane or

00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:17,696
buy a train or something, I don't care.

00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:19,636
But you have to do it yourself.

00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,996
As for me, I won't spend a dime

00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,456
on these luxuries.

00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:27,217
Papa, using money reasonably,

00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:28,856
isn’t extravagance, Papa!

00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,637
Here, Papa, calculate it yourself.

00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:32,237
Now, if Papa visits the

00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:33,717
fields by plane in one day, it's faster than

00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:35,476
a whole month of Papa going by car and boat.

00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:36,717
Doesn't Papa get a backache

00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:37,596
from sitting on the boat all the time?

00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,236
Time is money,

00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:40,796
so it's very beneficial, Papa.

00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:41,876
Beneficial or just for show?

00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:45,577
I've decided, Đăng, at thirty-two,

00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,376
no more playing around.

00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:48,576
I won't give you a cent.

00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:51,836
From today on, if you want to do

00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,856
anything, just take over the business.

00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,237
Decide for yourself.

00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:57,836
Sir, I think that...

00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,816
Papa, we have plenty of money,

00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,737
we have to let the Westerners

00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,336
see the potential, the strength

00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:04,676
of our people, Papa.

00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,016
No buying!

00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:07,236
Buy!

00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,276
I said no buying.

00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:10,356
I said buy.

00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:10,936
No buying.

00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:11,536
Buy.

00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,196
Where's the whip?

00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:19,576
Why there's so many, Third Brother?

00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:20,676
It's just me here,

00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:21,936
is it really necessary to be like this?

00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:25,356
(French).

00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:27,356
Thank you.

00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,376
Ouch!

00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:31,856
Hurts, but you're still acting up?

00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:34,736
Are you still on my side, Sau?

00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,596
I really can't understand Dad.

00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:38,956
We're all grown up, but he still

00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,156
drags us out and beats us so violently.

00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,856
And not just a normal beating, he drags us out and beats us

00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:44,936
in front of the servants.

00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,436
My butt can take it, but my face

00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:47,176
can't handle the shame.

00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,156
Ba, if I wear this dress,

00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,296
Dad will see it and beat me till I couldn’t walk.

00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:55,096
You act like you've never

00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:55,896
been beaten before?

00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:58,216
Yeah!

00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,316
Come here.

00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:01,556
What?

00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:04,236
Hold this for me.

00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:07,856
Need to cover more of the neck, cinch the waist a bit,

00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:10,116
and add a hat.

00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:13,176
I tell you, it'll be perfectly

00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:17,336
beautiful.

00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:21,156
Oh, wow.

00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:22,896
Wow, I didn't expect our sister

00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,076
to have such talent.

00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,816
Hey Sau, if I knew, I would have

00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,296
tried to take you with me, Sau.

00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,036
Over there, people with

00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,836
ideas, with style,

00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,676
and an open mind like Sau,

00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:35,856
are highly valued.

00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,776
Good heavens, dressing so weirdly,

00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,496
and you call that talent?

00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:41,876
Young lady, mind your words!

00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:44,236
Too weird, who would ever marry her?

00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:46,296
Here, come here, give it back.

00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:50,176
Here, honey, did it hurt

00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,756
a lot when you were beaten earlier?

00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,096
Let Mom put some ointment on it,

00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:54,456
and it'll be better soon.

00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,296
Merci, Mamaang.

00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:57,676
I'm grown up, I can rub it on myself.

00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:02,296
Mamaang,

00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:03,996
why don't you ever tell Papa

00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:05,476
not to hit us anymore?

00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:06,496
We're all grown up.

00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:09,276
Just got back and haven't even eaten yet,

00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:10,556
already got a whipping as an appetizer.

00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:12,676
Oh my god, I know my dad's temper,

00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,116
No one can reason with him.

00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:17,396
Look, about the degrees, he doesn't

00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,456
approve, but Mom, Mom does.

00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:22,256
In this whole Bac Lieu province, there's

00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:23,956
no one who can compare to you.

00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,636
Mom will throw a party for

00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:27,736
you to celebrate properly.

00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,556
Whatever it is, if Mom says it, your

00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:31,196
dad will nod right away.

00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,036
Mom, Mom, does that mean I get to wear

00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,376
all the new fashions?

00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:35,856
Hey you, move over,

00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,216
let Mom apply the ointment for you.

00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:38,476
I'll put it on myself.

00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:39,396
Let Mom put it on.

00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:40,876
No.

00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,276
I'll put the medicine on.

00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:43,156
I'll throw it away.

00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:44,516
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:09,136
(French) C'est avec un grand

00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:11,516
plaisir que je vous felicite

00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:12,816
d'avoir un fils aussi brillant.

00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:14,316
(Laughs) Thank you!

00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,856
Thank you, gentlemen, for your kind words.

00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:21,576
I still hope that you gentlemen

00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:23,696
will continue to support Bac Lieu

00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,916
so that it can become more prosperous.

00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,716
Ho ho!

00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:29,756
This big house of yours looks

00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,276
quite grand and imposing.

00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,096
So of course, you must be

00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,776
proud, right?

00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:37,716
(Laughs) Hello!

00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:40,716
Thanks to this occasion, my My Tho province

00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,056
also has a chance to be dazzled.

00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:46,896
Hopefully, we’ll get our share of the spotlight too.

00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,676
(Laughs) The governor is just being modest,

00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:53,816
My Tho is so prosperous

00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:56,196
and fertile, it doesn't

00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,796
need the support like the

00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,256
remote and isolated Bac Lieu.

00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:02,656
Right, right, right,

00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:04,096
right.

00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,376
Bac Lieu is so cool.

00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,596
My Tho is awesome.

00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,616
Speaking of rice, these two lands

00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:11,616
no one can compare.

00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:13,876
But this time,

00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:15,196
ah, Bac Lieu is awesome.

00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:16,776
I heard that Mr.

00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,536
Councilor has opened a bank

00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:19,836
in Saigon.

00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:22,296
Like the saying goes, "don't let fertile silt flow away,"

00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:33,576
save it for our rocky fields. (laughter)

00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:38,036
Si vous me permettez.

00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:46,676
Hello, gentlemen!

00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:47,836
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:50,336
(Laughter) Les affaires du

00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:51,716
gouvernement français vont mal.

00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,796
Nous ne pouvons plus obtenir de

00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,996
nouvelles colonies que nous pourrions

00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:57,856
forcer à ʜᴜɐ ʜᴜɐ ɛt nôɾ tronquille.

00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,136
Et ce sont les nations qui finissent

00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,956
par manger notre moɑɑɑɑte.

00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:02,536
Oh!

00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,176
C'est parce que nous n'avançons pas

00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:06,216
dans notre travail, et il nous faut

00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:08,816
apprendre de nos expériences.

00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,116
Avez-vous appris quelque chose

00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:12,416
qui puisse nous sortir de cette

00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:16,170
situation?Mais il est gouverneur

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,510
depuis treize ans à la façon

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,111
d'utiliser les forces, ou à la façon

00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,910
de ne jamais presser ce vol.

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,570
(laughter) I won't hide anything from you,

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,090
Governor and gentlemen!

00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:29,511
Besides absorbing

00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:31,450
the nobility of France,

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,410
learning how to innovate agriculture.

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,270
Moi (French) here is also very proud to have

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,250
passed the strict exam, obtained

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,710
the excellent licence de pilote

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,230
to be able to use aircraft to discharge seeds,

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,971
spread salt, water or visit

00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:45,390
fields.

00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:47,950
If only there was a plane available now

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,930
moi would personally take you

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,331
gentlemen for a few rounds to enjoy

00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,610
the pleasure of flying through the clouds.

00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,170
An airplane, huh?

00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,910
In this Annamite land, only His Majesty

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,810
Bao Dai owns airplanes.

00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,910
If now Mr. Ba Hon, from the Tran family,

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,050
also has one and can fly it himself,

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,610
then the status of

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,390
the Annamites would be elevated.

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,250
With Moi, anything is possible (laughter).

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,630
It's Tòng's world!

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:27,330
It's not a trivial matter to talk

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,390
about so casually (sneeze).

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,850
We, the people of Bac Lieu, are very

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,870
honored to be under the protection

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,850
of your Excellency the Governor-General.

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,230
There must be no exceptions!

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,090
There must be no exceptions! (laughter).

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,810
So what?

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:55,610
Are you scolding me?

00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,090
Guests are to be

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,350
treated with respect, not a place

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,950
for you to act superior.

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,770
You think you're so great because you went to a French school?

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,230
You need to think before you speak,

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,230
and consider the consequences of your actions.

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,970
Did I do anything too much, Papa?

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,970
You think that’s nothing wrong?

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,350
The land belongs to the Annamites,

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,650
but only the French

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,130
have the power to rule.

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,490
Me, my whole life,

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,270
I always look before

00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,730
I leap, for what?

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,950
It's to keep this family stable.

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,730
You eat and dress well,

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,010
don't act like you own the place.

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,070
Or you'll waste all the effort and

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,890
reputation of the Tang family.

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,130
Papa,

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,430
Passing the pilot's license exam

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,910
is a loss of honor, Papa?

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,670
Buying an airplane is

00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,230
a loss of honor, Papa?

00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,170
What I want is for the French to

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,670
respect our family.

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,690
Our family should be proud,

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,890
not like what Papa

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,750
said.

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,010
Giving you a proper

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,850
job to do, you refuse to accept it.

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,870
Always doing

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,950
trivial things, doing nonsense, doing rubbish.

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,390
Where's the whip?

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,130
Dad!

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,190
Ba Huy!

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,370
Papa, I'm all grown up now,

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,990
I'm in my twenties. (lit. ten-odd-twenty years old)

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,490
A pain in the butt is nothing compared to humiliation.

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,210
I'd rather beat myself than be humiliated.

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,210
My child!

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,510
What are you doing?

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,250
Oh my god!

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,370
What era is this? Why are you still teaching

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,550
us such outdated things, Papa?

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,830
If this whip could teach

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,930
us to be exactly as you

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,330
want, it would have worked

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,790
from the very first time.

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,690
Not after dozens,

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,210
hundreds, or thousands of times like this.

00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,370
You always want everything to be

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,910
exactly as you want it, in this house

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,370
everything has to be your way.

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,070
But there should be

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,850
exceptions to everything.

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,410
Third Brother!

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,930
What is it?

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,110
Couldn't sleep last night?

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,230
Stop

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,330
making wild guesses, Miss Nosy.

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,850
What?

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,350
What do you want?

00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,570
Can’t I just compliment you?

00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,690
I admit, Third Brother was really brave yesterday.

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,250
Brave? Brave my foot.

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,690
Last night, you saw

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,930
I was acting tough.

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,430
Inside, I was also afraid of Dad's anger.

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,310
But it was time for

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,830
Dad to understand that none of

00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,650
his children want to be

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,090
raised by the whip.

00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,690
Only you had the courage

00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,330
to say that to him.

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,290
What else can we do?

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,090
Think about it, Sáu.

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,050
We have so much money, enough to last three generations,

00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,130
We have so much money, enough to last three generations,

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,850
That's right, our family's money,

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,050
I'm telling you, our family money could last three lifetimes!

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,210
But you need to know

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,930
your dad's mindset is to spend one

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,290
coin and get ten coins in return.

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,210
Hey, Mom saw you going up

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,870
Saigon, and ask for that bank

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,590
then work there, so you could

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,050
avoiding him face-to-face here, isn't that right?

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,310
Forget it, let's take the salt field

00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,650
in Bac Lieu, that's good enough.

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,410
I'm telling you, living leisurely,

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,770
living a whole life is the best.

00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,210
Just like these pigeons here,

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,090
they fly around every day, fly wherever

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,530
they want, and come back when it's time to eat.

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,630
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly.

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,170
Eat well, then go out again.

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,850
Living like that is the best thing ever.

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,830
Instead of flying to Saigon to run a bank

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,050
and then buying an airplane,

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,730
you'll get bored after a couple of weeks.

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
It's true that

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,920
only maman loves her child the most.

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,640
(laughter) I will listen to maman.

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,480
That's right!

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,480
I will go to Saigon to take the bank

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,420
to have money to buy an airplane.

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,101
A couple of weeks, I might get bored, but

00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:48,041
if cậu Ba wants it, he has to get it.

00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:51,320
(background music) Maman,

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,041
maman must understand me the most, right?

00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,100
I am also a bird

00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,760
but I am an eagle.

00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:00,541
I fly really high, really far.

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,520
Farther than these pigeons.

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,720
Hoo hoo hoo hoo...

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,700
What eagle?

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,360
What airplane?

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
I feel like no one in this family

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,220
understands anyone.

00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,020
Um, anh Ba, what is the

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
bank really for?

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,180
It's the place where people often

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,680
bring money or valuables

00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,320
to our house to keep for them.

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Or they come to borrow money from us

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,500
and then pay interest every month.

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,880
Like the pawn shops

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,260
of our father.

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,020
Just a different name.

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,980
One is a bank,

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,880
one is a shop.

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,400
The house and the shop, that's it.

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,260
Are they the same?

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,980
So what are you planning to do

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,760
with that bank?

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,640
I'll take the money to buy a plane.

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,680
Buy a plane for what?

00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
A plane to fly.

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,840
Fly where?

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,780
Fly to the sky.

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:51,980
The sky?

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,520
What sky?

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,620
Buying a plane is my dream,

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,500
your Third Brother.

00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,480
And yet you talk about this little girl.

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,360
But dad is afraid of heights.

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,440
He's afraid, but I'm not.

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,220
How can you be so reckless?

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,080
Daring to overtake young master Ba.

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,900
You’re done, buddy.

00:20:52,700 --> 00:21:09,900
Hey Sau, we're in Saigon!

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,120
Are you okay, ma'am?

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,240
Are you okay, ma'am?

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,900
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
Ma'am, buy some medicine.

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,640
What's wrong, Sau?

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
Uncle Ba, this bank

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
it's papa’s, right?

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,840
C'est fou!

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,460
Whoa...

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,500
- Sau
- Yes?

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,620
Allez!

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,240
Allez!

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,720
Bonjour!

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,200
Sau!

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,300
Yes?

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,920
Why is no one here?

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:17,880
Huh?

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
What's the matter?

00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,900
Are you young master Ba?

00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Bonjour!

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,800
And you just-- oh, this is-

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,760
This is my sister Sau.

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,580
Hello, young master Ba.

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,260
Hello, Miss Sau.

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,440
I'm the director here.

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,060
Everyone, greet the new

00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,080
bank owner.

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,640
Hope that in the future

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,900
you will take care of us.

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,520
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,700
I don't intend to

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,520
bother you all for long.

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Go to the bank to get some money to buy

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,960
a plane and I'm done.

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,460
I hope he'll open the safe

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,540
and give me some money to

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,580
complete my business.

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:34,880
Um.

00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,920
This thing is uh- (door closing sound)

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,600
This

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,160
bank doesn't have any money.

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,840
You can see the situation

00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,960
outside.

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,300
So, there's no money,

00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,640
but there's plenty of rice and salt.

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
What about other things?

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,560
Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Ba?

00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,860
(laughter) Six!

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,640
Huh?

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,960
(door opening sound) But my

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,820
father has a lot of money.

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,640
Wouldn't he put some in here for safekeeping?

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,420
It's true that Mr.Councelor is very rich.

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,500
But business is business.

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,140
Opening a bank requires money to

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,600
come in from customers, then using that money

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,280
to do business and make a profit.

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,920
Opening a bank is for making profit, not

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,740
to be his personal vault, sir.

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,220
(laughter) (scoffing) Indeed,

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,720
(laughter) an old man's candidate.

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,120
(background music) Let's go home!

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,260
Giving up so soon, not at all like

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,700
the third brother I admire.

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,000
What else is there to do here?

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,660
As deserted as a tomb.

00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,800
Hey, look!

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,500
What kind of employees are so boring.

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,000
Their clothes are both old-fashioned and ugly.

00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,460
That huge safe,

00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,520
doesn't have a single penny in it.

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,040
Do you think going back to Bac Lieu will make your

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,420
father give you money to buy a plane?

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,380
Hey, if you don't like it,

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,400
then change it.

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,800
Oh my, these innovations

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,840
are your forte, right?

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,420
You studied in France,

00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,360
bring out the good stuff and get to work.

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,180
This is a real opportunity to impress

00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,960
your father, not those

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,260
degrees and diplomas.

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,060
That's right!

00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,540
Uh-oh.

00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
Our bank's first

00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,880
mission is to have money.

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,040
But-
