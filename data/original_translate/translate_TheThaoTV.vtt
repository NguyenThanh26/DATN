00:00:02.8 --> 00:00:03.8
In the history of this tournament,

00:00:03.8 --> 00:00:05.5
there have been one hundred and twelve

00:00:05.5 --> 00:00:08.4
hole-in-ones recorded, including a record of

00:00:08.4 --> 00:00:10.6
nine hole-in-ones in 2016.

00:00:11.4 --> 00:00:14.4
In 2024, there have been five hole-in-ones

00:00:14.4 --> 00:00:17.8
made during the Par 3 Contest,

00:00:17.8 --> 00:00:19.8
also known as the Par 3 competition.

00:00:20.7 --> 00:00:22.3
There have been nine Par 3 holes.

00:00:29.6 --> 00:00:31.6
Across the four Major events.

00:00:32.3 --> 00:00:33.1
Hole number seven.

00:00:35.2 --> 00:00:36.8
Speaking of Gary Player,

00:00:36.8 --> 00:00:39.2
he is considered as one of

00:00:39.2 --> 00:00:43.1
the great role models for golfers.

00:00:44.9 --> 00:00:46.7
This year, nearly ninety years old,

00:00:47.7 --> 00:00:50.1
the South African legend still

00:00:50.1 --> 00:00:53.9
shows agility and remains

00:00:53.9 --> 00:00:55.8
an inspiration

00:00:57.0 --> 00:00:58.6
for all younger generations with

00:00:59.4 --> 00:01:02.4
his hard work, dedication, and effort,

00:01:02.4 --> 00:01:04.3
eventually becoming

00:01:04.3 --> 00:01:05.6
one of the all-time greats,

00:01:07.3 --> 00:01:09.4
one of the Big Three in golf,

00:01:10.9 --> 00:01:11.5
both now and then.

00:01:12.1 --> 00:01:12.9
And we have witnessed

00:01:12.9 --> 00:01:14.0
a hole-in-one score

00:01:14.0 --> 00:01:16.7
in this season.

00:01:24.0 --> 00:01:25.5
That is the special emotion

00:01:26.3 --> 00:01:28.2
of the Par 3 contest.

00:01:32.5 --> 00:01:37.0
In 2025, we are

00:01:37.0 --> 00:01:38.6
re-watching the hole-in-one

00:01:40.1 --> 00:01:41.4
by Keegan Brassley.

00:01:45.9 --> 00:01:47.4
Clearly, this is one of the

00:01:48.5 --> 00:01:50.1
wonderful years for Keegan Brassley as

00:01:50.1 --> 00:01:52.5
aside from the Par 3 Contest,

00:01:52.5 --> 00:01:55.0
Keegan Brassley has already

00:01:55.0 --> 00:01:56.3
scored two hole-in-ones this year.

00:01:58.8 --> 00:02:00.7
And the most recent one was

00:02:01.6 --> 00:02:03.0
at The Players Championship.

00:02:03.7 --> 00:02:05.4
Right now, on the leaderboard

00:02:05.4 --> 00:02:07.1
of the Par 3 contest,

00:02:07.1 --> 00:02:08.6
Bubba Watson is leading with

00:02:08.6 --> 00:02:09.7
a score of minus three.

00:02:10.4 --> 00:02:12.4
Mark O'Meara and David Slaby are

00:02:12.4 --> 00:02:13.5
tied for second place

00:02:13.5 --> 00:02:14.7
with a score of minus two.

00:02:24.1 --> 00:02:25.2
The ball is rolling down the slope.

00:02:25.2 --> 00:02:26.1
Will it be a hole-in-one?

00:02:29.9 --> 00:02:31.1
Just a bit more power,

00:02:31.1 --> 00:02:32.3
and it would have been a hole-in-one.

00:02:34.6 --> 00:02:35.3
Jack Johnson.

00:02:43.2 --> 00:02:45.5
No hole-in-one at hole number

00:02:45.5 --> 00:02:48.0
four for Jack Johnson, the former

00:02:48.0 --> 00:02:50.2
captain of the US Ryder Cup team.

00:03:03.5 --> 00:03:07.1
Perhaps with the Par 3 contest,

00:03:07.1 --> 00:03:09.1
people are eagerly waiting

00:03:09.1 --> 00:03:10.4
for more hole-in-ones.

00:03:16.5 --> 00:03:17.9
Nikolai Hojgaard's shot

00:03:17.9 --> 00:03:19.2
at hole number six.

00:03:19.2 --> 00:03:20.4
Will it be a hole-in-one?

00:03:20.4 --> 00:03:21.6
No hole-in-one.

00:03:22.9 --> 00:03:24.0
Clearly, we are all waiting

00:03:24.0 --> 00:03:25.4
for shots like that.

00:03:29.5 --> 00:03:30.8
This is Jonathan Vegard,

00:03:32.4 --> 00:03:33.2
at hole number eight.

00:03:38.1 --> 00:03:40.9
The ball went strong to the back,

00:03:40.9 --> 00:03:42.3
but now it's rolling back down.

00:03:54.4 --> 00:03:55.3
We can see the ball

00:03:55.3 --> 00:03:56.4
still rolling after

00:03:56.4 --> 00:03:57.8
Vegard's shot.

00:03:59.2 --> 00:04:00.6
Will it roll directly

00:04:00.6 --> 00:04:02.0
into the hole?

00:04:05.2 --> 00:04:06.1
What a pity!

00:04:11.5 --> 00:04:13.4
A shot by Rasmus Hojgaard.

00:04:15.9 --> 00:04:17.9
The ball rolls back quickly.

00:04:17.9 --> 00:04:18.7
Could it be a hole-in-one?

00:04:19.2 --> 00:04:20.4
No hole-in-one!

00:04:21.6 --> 00:04:23.2
Such a pity, still no

00:04:23.2 --> 00:04:25.2
second hole-in-one today

00:04:25.2 --> 00:04:27.8
in the Par 3 contest.

00:04:32.3 --> 00:04:33.6
Could this be the person

00:04:33.6 --> 00:04:37.2
to bring us another hole-in-one?

00:04:40.4 --> 00:04:41.3
Tom Haughey.

00:04:42.1 --> 00:04:43.5
That's right, Tom Haughey!

00:04:46.2 --> 00:04:47.9
And that is the second

00:04:49.2 --> 00:04:52.7
hole-in-one of this year's Par 3 contest.

00:04:55.4 --> 00:04:56.4
Let's watch again

00:04:57.4 --> 00:04:58.6
Tom Haughey's shot.

00:05:10.4 --> 00:05:13.0
All that's left for Tom Haughey

00:05:13.0 --> 00:05:14.9
is simply to pick up the ball.

00:05:16.4 --> 00:05:17.4
Jack Johnson's shot

00:05:17.4 --> 00:05:18.3
at hole number eight.

00:05:27.3 --> 00:05:29.2
No third hole-in-one,

00:05:30.1 --> 00:05:32.2
a right-to-left curl,

00:05:32.2 --> 00:05:34.0
sloping nicely, a stunning arc

00:05:34.8 --> 00:05:36.9
from Jack Johnson.

00:05:48.1 --> 00:05:49.4
And the expected player

00:05:49.4 --> 00:05:51.7
besides the gallery is Ruimac Roy.

00:05:54.9 --> 00:05:56.7
For over ten years, Ruimac Roy still hasn't...
